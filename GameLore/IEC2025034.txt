+ You were not meant to leave.
+ You left anyway.

+ You remember her voice before you remember her face.
+ That feels important.

+ The world is cold when you start moving.
+ Snow stretches farther than it should.
+ The wind sounds like something trying to speak and failing.

+ You walk because standing still hurts more.

+ Shapes move in the snow.
+ Ice forms itself into figures.
+ They don’t attack immediately.
+ They wait until you stop.

+ You find scraps half-buried under ice.
+ Notes written in a familiar hand.
+ Not hers.
+ But close.

+ One note reads:
  "She went ahead."
  "She said the forest was warmer."
  "She said she could feel something there."

+ Crows circle overhead.
+ They watch.
+ Sometimes they drop objects you recognize.
+ Sometimes they drop nothing.

+ You move into the forest.

+ The air changes.
+ Breathing feels easier.
+ The light filters through leaves like it’s trying to help.

+ Wolves appear between the trees.
+ They don’t chase.
+ They follow.

+ You hear her laugh.
+ It comes from nowhere.
+ You turn too fast.
+ The sound stops.

+ Mushrooms blend into the ground.
+ Some look like stones.
+ Some look like paths.
+ Some release spores when you get too close.

+ The spores make you see her walking ahead.
+ You follow.
+ You always follow.

+ Skeletons appear on the road out of the forest.
+ They wear clothes meant for travel.
+ They carry bags packed carefully.
+ Some hold letters they never finished.

+ One letter reads:
  "I thought love would be enough."
  "I was wrong."
  "Or I was too early."

+ You reach the city.

+ Buildings stand but feel hollow.
+ Roads lead nowhere.
+ Signs point to places that no longer exist.

+ Crows sit on rooftops.
+ They don’t move when you approach.

+ Ice forms inside doorways.
+ Frozen figures block passages.
+ Some look like they were holding hands.

+ You find a final recording:
  "If you’re still walking, don’t stop."
  "She isn’t lost."
  "Neither are you."
  "The world just doesn’t end where you think it does."

+ You keep moving.

+ There is no clear destination.
+ Only forward.

+ Somewhere ahead, something warm still exists.
+ You believe that.
+ That belief is enough to keep walking.

+ End of log.
