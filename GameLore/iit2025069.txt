Start
You're a rookie soldier,
Every month you go to the nearby military base to retrieve equipment.
This month was the same you were on your way but the contact with the military base was lost
a few weeks ago, not a big deal in harsh climate conditions this was a recurring problem.
You reach the military base but no one is at the gates, unbothered you go inside and your vehicle jams these kinds of things
are common in the snowwwyyy biome though so you get off the vehicle and continue on foot.
As you progress forward you are faced with undead skeletons in the uniforms the soldiers wear ,
you fight for your life against the undead soldiers in their pockets you find notes and dog tags.
The notes read " Something went wrong" " they said head for the city" "The city lights are still visible" 
You hear radio logs "any unit still inside the base , fall back... head for the city" 
"If you're alive, move head through the forest. THE CITY IS STILL STANDING".
You keeping moving forward the notes read 
"If you hear crows, don't stop moving" "The ground isn't safe either.. this isn't natural" 
Radio logs say
"lost visual!! wolves are hiding in the forests. They are unbothered by gunfire..." 
"Don't stop- don't check on the others- RUN TO THE CITY!!"
you reach the city, no civilians, no fires everything is abandoned.
the notes read "streets are blocked, so are the rooftops"
"Creatures made of ice moving-"
besides a undead soldier you hear a radio log he was recording says 
"If anyone hears this.. the city isn't safe but you have to keep moving forward help is on the way..."
You keep moving forward
there is nothing up ahead
you collapse on to the ground from fatigue
and wake up at the gates of the military base
The end :)
